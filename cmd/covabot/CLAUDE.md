# CovaBot — Development Instructions

> See also: `wiki/bots/CovaBot.md`

## Goals & Purpose

AI personality emulator. Generates LLM-driven replies that mimic a specific
user's tone and conversational style. Ported from starbunk-js CovaBot.

## Major Features

- **4-stage decision pipeline:** hard filters → mention check → social battery
  → LLM generation. A message must pass every stage before a reply is sent.
- Personality-driven LLM response generation.
- Conversational context modelling (conversation history as prompt context).
- **Social battery** — CovaBot tracks an engagement score; it becomes less
  responsive as the score drains and more responsive as it recharges.
- Multi-provider LLM fallback chain: Ollama → Gemini → OpenAI.

## Dependencies & Architecture

- `internal/bot.Run` — event loop and session management.
- `internal/discord.MessagingService` — sends replies.
- LLM provider: configured via `LOCAL_LLM_PROVIDER` / `CLOUD_LLM_PROVIDER` env vars (not yet wired).
- All LLM calls must be fully async and timeout-resistant.

## Edge Cases

- Handle all LLM providers failing simultaneously — log and stay silent rather
  than crash. Priority order: Ollama → Anthropic → Gemini → OpenAI.
- Ignore messages from other bots (`m.Author.Bot`) to prevent infinite reply
  loops.
- Manage LLM rate limits with exponential backoff; do not block the event loop.
- Avoid hallucination bleed-through — truncate or summarise long context
  threads before sending them as prompt context.
- The social battery state must persist across restarts (store in DB or file);
  do not reset it every time the bot comes up.
